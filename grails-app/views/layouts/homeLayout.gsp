        <h3>The Future of Grails</h2>
   		<p>We have reached an inflection point in Java web development. The last one we met on this scale was the rise of Spring, as it aggressively displaced most of J2EE. A consensus formed soon after Spring was paired with Struts,
   		that this, finally, was the way to do Java web development. Take some MVC implementation, attach to a Spring IoC container, or Guice if you want to be radical....</p>

   <h3>Groovy and Grails thoughts</h3>
   	<p>I've been slowly banging away at a small Grails app on the train to and from work, to teach myself Groovy the language and Grails the web framework. I already had a good familiarity with Java, Spring and Hibernate so it is mostly

   	<p>A time comes for every open source project when it has to take a step back, reflect on the past and decide where it needs to go next. The world rarely stays the same as when the project was born and in the tech world things change
   	year on year. Back when Grails first came out, Java web frameworks were still a pain to configure and you had to pull together a whole host of libraries to do what you wanted....</p>

   <h3>Groovy and Grails</h3>
   	<p>I’m so amazed when I see how so few companies are using Groovy and Grails right now, and are still using old stuff like Spring and Hibernate, that I thought I would jump in and do my share of educating. And why not give in to the fashion
   	 of top lists while I’m at it? So here it goes: if you are an enterprise software architect and you have a lot of Java in your world, you might want to read carefully what follows.....</p>
